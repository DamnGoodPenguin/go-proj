# Devops on Go server  

## A simple httpserver written in go which servers 2 endpoints

- /requests
  - Which increments the hits and saves in **Redis** and shows "hello world".  
- /queries
  - Which presents the number of hits.  

## Devops practices done on app

## - Containerization of httpserver including redis

## - Docker-Compose build for the app

## - Deployed Kubernetes Cluster for the app
